##Usage:
#Input:
# [X] = Signal Measurement Matrix of size c x N, where N = number of samples and c is number of input signals

function [R] = compute_variance_covariance_matrix (X)
  [a,b] = size(X);
  inputs = b;
  samples = a;
  one = ones(samples,1);
  x = X-(one*one'*X)/samples;
  V = (1/samples)*x'*x;
  R = V;
  
endfunction
